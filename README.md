# GroceryCalorieCounter Web Application

This web application was built using a React frontend and a Node/Express backend. It allows a user to enter a max amount of calories and search up a food item,
sorted by "Best Match" or "Lowest Calories". The results render the brand, food item description, calories per serving, serving size, and serving unit. This application allows you to save items to a "Shopping Cart". 

The backend server is currently running on heroku and because the free subscription only allows one "dyno", it is possible that if multiple users are on at the same time, the server may account for the multiple users rather than the individual.
